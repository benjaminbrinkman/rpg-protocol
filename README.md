What is RPG Protocol?

The RPG Protocol is an emerging open standard that is working towards 
making the final frontier of interactive media, video games (in the form 
of roleplaying games) a possibility for any creative individual.  The 
goal is, if you create content for any medium including but not limited 
to blogs, videos, graphics, writing, etc., than you are already very few 
steps away from creating a complete RPG limited only by your 
imagination.

What can't RPG Protocol do?

RPG Protocol is not a graphics engine. Not 3D, not 2D, nothing of the 
sort.  The idea is, to be able to create a game that is completely 
text-based if you want, that can be accessed via telnet.  Now, if you 
want to make a game with graphics, the functionality of RPG Protocol can 
be tapped into from almost any game engine, library, or SDK.

Development is currently focused on defining data that is used for 
providing RPG content.  Once that is done, plans are in place to use 
python-twisted to develop a server that can go anywhere from playing a 
text-based RPG via telnet, to providing a server for a full-blown 
graphical 2D or 3D RPG, single player or multiplayer.
